# Ruby Chess

This is a command-line Ruby implementation of single-player Chess with an AI
opponent. The program uses the [colorize][colorize-link] gem.

To play, clone this repo, navigate to the directory from the command line and
run bundle install. Then open up your favorite Ruby interpreter, and run
```load "lib/chess.rb" ```. There is no save game included in the repo, so when
asked to load from file, press "n", and start playing!
