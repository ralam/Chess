# Ruby Chess

This is a command-line Ruby implementation of single-player Chess with an AI
opponent. The program requires the [colorize][colorize-link] gem to run.

To play, download this repo, navigate to the directory from the command line,
open up your favorite Ruby interpreter, and run ```load "lib/chess.rb" ```.
There is no save game included in the repo, so when asked to load from file,
press "n", and start playing!
