# Ruby Chess

This is a command-line Ruby implementation of single-player Chess with an AI
opponent. To play, you'll need to install the [colorize][colorize-link] gem if
you don't have it already. Then, download this repo, navigate to the directory
from the command line, open up your favorite Ruby interpreter, and run
```ruby load "lib/chess.rb" ```. There is no save game included in the repo, so
when asked to load from file, press "n", and start playing!
